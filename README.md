## About the company

I have been working in data science for more than 22 years.  During that time I have worked in many places, spoken at many conferences, and met many people working in the field.  Patterns started to emerge in my conversations with them on how their businesses were trying to become data driven and creating data products and solutions.  One of the biggest patterns I saw was that many of these companies and organizations were stuck trying to figure out how to go from A to B.  They had funded the creation of teams and not gotten the ROI they expected.  They were trying to make data-driven decisions but were frustrated by the actual lack of data.  The upper leadership never fully developed trust in the data and would still make decisions based off of intuition.

This is actually very common.  

- 87% of data science projects never make it to production (VentureBeat, 2019)
- 85% of projects in AI and so-called “big data” fail (Gartner, 2017)
- “Through 2022, only 20% of analytic insights will deliver business outcomes” (Gartner, 2019)

**The reality is that this is fixable if you already are suffering from this problem, preventable if you are just getting started.**

I described this in a blog post titled ["Not getting what you expect out of your data science team?  The “upside-down approach” to creating the team and why it is doomed to fail](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/getting-what-you-expect-out-your-data-science-team-dr-clair-sullivan-ftbkc%3FtrackingId=0ZjseqW1TYmL2wYiBUxm%252BQ%253D%253D/?trackingId=0ZjseqW1TYmL2wYiBUxm%2BQ%3D%3D).  

It can be fixed.  Yet 72% of survey respondents in NewVantage Partners’ 2021 Big Data and AI Executive Survey said that only 24% of Fortune 1000 businesses considered themselves to be data driven with 92.2% of mainstream companies reporting that they continue to struggle with cultural challenges relating to data ([Harvard Business Review](https://hbr.org/2021/02/why-is-it-so-hard-to-become-a-data-driven-company), 2021). 

This is why I created this company.  I want to work with you and your organization to either set your data science function up avoiding the "upside-down approach" or help you fix it if it is there.  

If this is of interest to you, please email me (link to the left) or [schedule a time with me](https://calendly.com/clair-j-sullivan/30min)) to discuss your needs.
