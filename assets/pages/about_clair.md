Hello!

My name is Dr. Clair Sullivan and I am the Founder and CEO of Clair Sullivan and Associates, LLC.  In this role, I provide consulting services to those looking to create new data science teams or to figure out how to create a better data culture.  Interested in learning more?  Check out [this blog post](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/getting-what-you-expect-out-your-data-science-team-dr-clair-sullivan-ftbkc%3FtrackingId=0ZjseqW1TYmL2wYiBUxm%252BQ%253D%253D/?trackingId=0ZjseqW1TYmL2wYiBUxm%2BQ%3D%3D) and read about my perspective on the "upside down" data culture.

I have been working in data science, machine learning, and related fields of signal processing for a variety of employers (startups, academia, and the federal government) since obtaining my PhD in 2002 (even though it wasn't called "data science" back then!).  Prior to starting my own company I was the Director of Data Science for Vail Resorts, leading a team of data scientists and machine learning engineers on marketing models for the company.  Before that I was a graph data science advocate at Neo4j, working to expand the community of data scientists and machine learning engineers using graphs to solve challenging problems.  And before that I worked as a machine learning engineer at GitHub, a professor at the University of Illinois, and a researcher in the federal government.  I also previously ran a different consulting company, La Neige Analytics, whose purpose wass to provide data science expertise to the ski industry.  I have also authored 4 book chapters, over 20 peer-reviewed papers, and more than 30 conference papers.  Lastly, I was the recipient of the DARPA Young Faculty Award in 2014 and the American Nuclear Society's Mary J. Oestmann Professional Women's Achievement Award in 2015.
